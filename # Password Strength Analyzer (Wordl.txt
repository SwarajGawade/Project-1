# Password Strength Analyzer (Wordlist-based)

## 1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **password strength analyzer** that evaluates passwords against a given wordlist. 
It simulates how weak passwords can be easily guessed using dictionary-based attacks.

## 2. Objectives
- Understand the importance of strong passwords.
- Show how dictionary attacks work using a wordlist.
- Provide feedback on password strength based on analysis.

## 3. Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **NLTK / zxcvbn** (if included in requirements)
- **Custom Wordlist**
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## 4. Installation & Setup
1. Clone or extract the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd password_strength_wordlist
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analyzer:
   ```bash
   python analyzer.py
   ```

## 5. How It Works
- The script takes a password as input.
- It checks the password against a wordlist.
- It evaluates length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
- Provides a **strength score** and recommendations.

## 6. Example Usage
```bash
Enter a password: password123
Result: Weak â€“ Found in common wordlist!
Suggestion: Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
```

## 7. Possible Improvements
- Implement brute-force simulation.
- Add entropy-based scoring.
- Integrate with password breach APIs.

## 8. Conclusion
This project highlights how weak or common passwords are easily exploitable and emphasizes the need for complex, unique passwords.
